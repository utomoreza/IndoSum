# Summarization Task
This repo is used to support the Medium article written [here](https://utomorezadwi.medium.com/bert-extractive-summarizer-vs-word2vec-extractive-summarizer-which-one-is-better-and-faster-c6d6d172cb91).

The article TL; DR is as follows:
*Letâ€™s define an extractive summarization using BERT or Word2Vec. Which one will be the winner in terms of processing speed and accuracy? We will compare them by using public summarization datasets. Hint: bigger not always better.*
